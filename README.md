# Abenson Smartphones Web Scraping

Abenson is one of the most famous appliances and gadget stores in the Philippines that provides online transactions on their website and installment options mostly on their electronic sales.

The purpose of this project is primarily for Filipino students that still experience online classes due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This web scraped data determines the right fit for the smartphone depending on the price and specification.

The data obtained is saved in a Microsoft Excel file named "abenson_smartphones.xlsx" for open access and easy use.
